This was a tough one to crack being busy with work and other studies didn't help. Not making excuses, i slacked a little bit. Part of it was the frustration of not getting the read and unread button to work on a specific book title. I figured out the logic eventually, but had to go to chatgpt to understand how to implement it.

In the end, I'm happy with how it turned out.
